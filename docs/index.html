<p>This course adopts a flipped classroom style for all lecture meetings and uses contract grading for assessment. Each week, video recordings are provided, to be studied outside of class meeting times (replacing assigned readings; occasionally readings may also be assigned). During the MWF lecture meetings, we will work on case studies or problem sets relating to that week’s material. Some days may be devoted to student-chosen topics. Weekly lab sessions will focus with greater depth on selected lecture topics and associated skills.</p>

</h2>
<p>In this course, we use a form of contract grading, a method of assessment in which you complete a contract laying out the work you must complete to a satisfactory level in order to earn a specific letter grade.</p>
<p>Read the following contract requirements carefully before filling out the Grade Contract form to complete your contract. <text style="background-color:yellow"><strong>Contracts are due by Fri Sep 8.</strong></text></p>
<p>If you have questions about the contract process, email or visit Angie to discuss.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="general-overview-and-expectations">General Overview and Expectations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#general-overview-and-expectations"></a>
</h3>
<p>In this course, you will determine your final grade based on the amount of work that you complete to a satisfactory level (as determined by the instructor). All passing grades will be expected to complete a baseline amount of work while higher grades will require additional work to be completed to satisfactory (thus, a higher level of mastery). Letter or number grades will not be assigned for any assignments. Instead, when work is returned to you it will be marked either “Satisfactory” or “Revise”. Any work marked Satisfactory needs no more attention from you. Work marked Revise requires that you address the comments provided by the instructor and attempt to correct errors in the assignment, turning in a revised version of the assignment within one week. If that revision is sufficient, it will be returned as Satisfactory; if not, additonal revisions may be needed or perhaps a meeting with the instructor. More than 2 revisions requires a one-on-one meeting with the instructor. At the end of the semester, you and I will determine your grade depending on how many of each assignment you completed to Satisfactory.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, you will be responsible for determining due dates for some assignments for this course (including exams). Generally, you must turn in quizzes or problem sets within 2 weeks of the due date though exceptions can be arranged individually with the instructor. Late assignments may carry consequences for you or impact your final grade.</p>
<p>I am choosing to use contract grading in order to provide you ownership over your grade and to enable you to focus more on what you are actually trying to learn. As a further benefit, contract grading helps you to develop and practice valuable life skills such as time management and the ability to assess the quality of your own work. Grades do not follow you into jobs after college (unless you do more schooling!), so it’s important to learn to assess yourself.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the work expected to be Satisfactory in order to achieve a grade of B. Applying +/- to the grades will be decided by you and I at the end of the term and can be used to adjust for discrepancies from the guidelines below (such as work turned in but not revised as requested). Grades of D and F are reserved for cases in which there is a systematic failure to meet contractual obligations.</p>
<p>To complete the work required for a B, expectations are that you will spend at least 11 hours per week on this course.</p>
<p><strong>Table of expectations</strong></p>
<p>Earning an A will require all of the work for a B plus completion of 1 additional project, exploring a course topic or topics in greater depth. <text style="background-color:yellow"><strong>Project goals and plan must be set by Oct 6 and completed by Dec 1.</strong></text></p>
<p>Earning a C will occur when work required for a B is not completed to Satisfactory or in a timely fashion (repeatedly late).</p>

<p>A set of content videos is assigned for each week (videos less than 20m each), providing the content that you are learning in a traditional lecture format. Live class meetings will focus on particular aspects of the content and explore them in greater depth via case studies. Weekly quizzes (about 10-20 multiple choice or true/false questions) practice the understanding you are learning in the videos and lecture meetings. You will receive your score on these quizzes immediately upon completion. For any questions for which you did not achieve full credit, you will revisions explaining why you got the question wrong and how you know the correct answer(s) is correct.

<p>In order to practice your understanding of the content video material and in-class materials, you will complete a weekly problem set focused on that week’s material. Optional supplemental readings will also be provided in most cases. You may use any source of information that you desire to complete these problem sets, including working with other students in the course (such as your assigned group). Once completed, you will check your answers against the key provided by Angie. For any incorrect responses, you will endeavor to correct them and provide a written explanation of what you think led you astray. You will submit your responses and your corrections as a single document. If you had correct responses for all the questions, you will still be sure to reply to the reflection question on the submission form in order to achieve a Satisfactory assignment. Revisions are not be requested for problem sets: all assignments that fit the above criteria are accepted as Satisfactory (you must respond to the reflection question on the submission form).</p>

<p>In order to bring together your learning in live lecture meetings, during lab periods, and from the content videos, there will be 4 short-answer exams. These exams will be open-note, open-book, and untimed but designed to require 50 minutes to complete (if studied for). This means you may use any materials supplied by Angie to complete the exam but you should not discuss the exam with anyone other than Angie. There will be no time limit on completion of the exam and all exams will be available as of the first day of class. You am responsible for scheduling when you will take each exam. For responses that are not Satisfactory, Angie will give you feedback and you will revise your response(s) until achieving Satisfactory. I suggest you choose due dates no earlier than the following to ensure all material is covered in class before you work on the exam:</p>
<ul>
<li><text style="background-color:yellow"><strong>Exam 1 after Sep 29</strong></text></li>
<li><text style="background-color:yellow"><strong>Exam 2 after Oct 27</strong></text></li>
<li><text style="background-color:yellow"><strong>Exam 3 after Nov 22</strong></text></li>
<li><text style="background-color:yellow"><strong>Exam 4 must be after Dec 12 and before 4pm Dec 17</strong></text></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="id_5-self-reflections-mid-semester-and-final---you-choose-due-dates">(5) Self-reflections (mid-semester and final) - You choose due dates.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#id_5-self-reflections-mid-semester-and-final---you-choose-due-dates"></a>
</h4>
<p>One important skill you will practice in this class is self-assessment, the idea that you develop your own standards for your work rather than merely hoping that your work meets someone else’s standards. To that end, it’s important that you engage in a process of self-reflection. It is only by examining how things have gone and comparing that to how you might like them to have gone, that you can plan for making adjustments in the future. <text style="background-color:yellow"><strong>For this course, you will undertake one self-reflection in the middle of the semester (by Oct 13) and a second at the end of the term (by Dec 17).</strong></text> For each, you will complete and submit the provided form before attending a short meeting scheduled with Angie to discuss your responses.</p>
