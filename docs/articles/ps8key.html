<ol>
<li>
When we think about how evolutionary forces cause genetic change in
populations, we need to consider their effects at multiple levels. Let’s
do this with the evolutionary force of mutation.
</li>
<br><ol type="a">
<li>
When a new mutation occurs in an individual, how does it impact
variation within that individual’s population (consider average
heterozygosity)? Explain.
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">When a mutation occurs in one organism in a
population, it is likely to produce a new allele for the locus in which
it occurs. This is because mutations are random and thus it is not
terribly likely that the exact change will already exist in another
individual. That means that a mutation occurring increases genetic
variation in the whole population, because a new allele has arisen.
Thus, we see a small increase in heterozygosity when a new mutation
occurs.</text><br></p>
<li>
When a new mutation occurs in an individual in a population, does it
make different populations more genetically alike or more genetically
divergent? Explain.
</li>
<text style="color:blue">If we consider 2 populations (A and B) and a
new mutation happens in an individual in population A. From the previous
question, we realize that this mutation will not have occurred in
population B, since it’s extremely unlikely for the exact same change to
happen at random in two populations at once. Thus, we now have a new way
in which population A is different from population B, it has this new
unique mutation. So, we would say that the new mutation has made the two
populations differ more than before, they are now more genetically
divergent.</text>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<li>
When we think about the types of mutations that may occur and their
possible effects on the organism’s phenotype, we need to consider
mutations in light of what we know about gene expression.
</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>
What types of mutations might be likely to be neutral, having no effect
on the organism’s phenotype?
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">Mutations that occur in non-coding regions,
with no regulatory function, won’t impact the phenotype. Similarly, we
think mutations that change the wobble base in a codon (don’t change the
amino acid, synonymous mutations) are also unlikely to alter the
organism’s phenotype. </text><br></p>
<li>
What types of mutations are likely to have an effect on phenotype even
when you only have one copy? What about those only likely to have an
effect on phenotype if you have two copies?
</li>
<text style="color:blue">Mutations that are likely to change phenotype
when you have one copy are likely to be ones that alter amino acids
(maybe changing protein function) or that impact how much mRNA is
produced (without stopping transcription altogether), like changes to
enhancers or silencers. Mutations that will only show in phenotype if
you have two copies are most likely to be ones that prevent
transcription of a gene altogether or alter the protein so that it
doesn’t function at all anymore. As long as you have one working copy,
it’s possible that this kind of mutation would not affect phenotype.
</text>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<li>
We think of gene flow as a force that keeps populations genetically
similar and preserves genetic variation within a population. Is this
always a good thing? Can you think of scenarios where gene flow might
not be the best thing for the average survival and reproduction of a
population?
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">Gene flow can be thought of as the thing
that keeps everyone in a species part of that species. However,
sometimes a species has many populations found in different
environments. In this case, it’s possible that the populations become
adapted to their specific conditions – for example the salinity of the
soil. If some populations experience high salinity and adapt so that
they have a high frequency of alleles that are helpful with high
salinity, then it could be harmful to survival if individuals arrive
from low salinity environments (and lack the high salinity alleles) and
then breed with the high salinity individuals. The offspring will not be
as well adapted to high salinity. Without that gene flow, the high
salinity population would have higher average survival. </text><br></p>
<li>
Why is the loss of genetic variation due to genetic drift in small
populations considered such a serious problem in conservation? Small
populations are still experiencing spontaneous mutations, so won’t they
be increasing genetic variation that way?
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">Mutation will increase genetic variation
only slowly, taking thousands of years to restore genetic variation lost
due to drift (which sometimes depletes genetic variation very rapidly).
Thus, mutuation is not sufficient to counter drift in the short
term.</text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">In addition, we typically think that
maintaining genetic variation is beneficial in case the environment
should change, then there is some chance that some variants will be more
successful in the new environment. Of course, an environmental change
that favors only some variants will necessarily reduce genetic variation
too (but only for the parts of the genome involved in the traits that
are favored). </text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">The bottom line is that we think genetic
variation can act as a buffer, enabling populations to persist when
change occurs. Having low genetic variation <em>can</em> be a problem
but we don’t actually have many examples of it causing a major problem
in natural populations (cheetahs lack variation but seem to be doing ok,
aside from problems caused by humans). </text><br></p>
<li>
What is a genetic bottleneck? What is the founder effect? How are these
phenomena different?
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">A genetic bottleneck is when a sizable
population suddenly decreases a lot in size, like in one generation
going from thousands to a few hundred (the population size narrows like
the neck of a bottle). So this occurs to a population that is living in
its usual environment but something happens that rapidly kills many,
many individuals at random (natural disaster like a hurricane?).
Generally, we might expect a population to grow rapidly after this
happens unless the cause of the sudden high mortality is still present.
This sudden loss of numbers can cause a random loss of genetic variation
(those who survived didn’t do so because they had better genes, it was
luck of the draw). </text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">A founder effect is when a small subset of a
large population leaves and “founds” a new population in a new location,
previously uninhabited by this species. The group of founders may be
small and therefore at random may not be representative of the genetic
variation of the larger population (again, by chance). The new
population, being small and in a new area probably without much
competition, is expected to grow quickly and thus restore a larger
population size – but variation that was not present in the initial
founders will still be lacking.</text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">As you can see, these phenomena are
different in that a genetic bottleneck occurs to an existing population
– which could mean that the variation that is lost can not be recovered
by other means. In some cases, bottlenecks might impact entire species
(if they are not widespread on the planet). In contrast, the founder
effect is when a new population arises from a few individuals and they
by chance start out with little variation. In this case, there is some
possibility that some variation could be recovered IF migrants arrive
from other populations. </text><br></p>
<li>
If a population does not experience a genetic bottleneck or a founder
effect, will it still change due to genetic drift? Explain.
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">Yes, even without a genetic bottleneck or a
founder effect, ALL POPULATIONS ALWAYS EXPERIENCE GENETIC DRIFT. This is
a result of the fact that populations are finite in size and there will
always be some amount of random change between generations due to
chance. However, larger populations will experience smaller amounts of
genetic drift (smaller chance changes in allele frequency over
generations) as compared to smaller populations. </text><br></p>
<li>
Genetic drift leads to the loss of genetic variation within populations,
increasing the difference from other populations. We often view drift as
a force that leads to problems for a population due to the loss of
variation. But we should think carefully. Will genetic drift always lead
to the loss of genetic variation? Since genetic drift causes populations
to become more different from each other, what might be the long-term
consequence of that process?
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">Genetic drift, given enough time, will
eventually lead to the loss of genetic variation within a population.
However, when there are multiple populations (which is most of the
time), that means that populations will become more different from each
other, thus there may be more genetic variation in the species, even if
not in individual populations. In the long-term, two populations could
become so different from each other, just by the accumulation of chance
changes over time, that they are no longer able to inter-breed and
become considered different species.</text></p>
