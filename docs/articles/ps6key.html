<ol>
<li>
Consider the four-o’clock plant (<i>Mirabilis jalapa</i>), in which
there are two alleles for flower color, <i>R</i> (homozygotes have red
flowers) and <i>W</i> (homozygotes have white flowers). A homozygous
plant is also called “true-breeding” because all of its gametes will
inherit the same allele. And if you cross two true-breeding red-flowered
plants, then you know the offspring will “breed true”; the offspring
will all have red flowers like their parents. If you cross a
true-breeding red-flowered plant with a true-breeding white-flowered
plant, the offspring have pink flowers.
</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Write out the genotypes of the two true-breeding parents and of the
offspring. Which are homozygous? Heterozygous?
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">True-breeding parents
crossed: RR × W W. Offspring will all be RW (and have pink flowers). The
parents were homozygous but all of the offspring are heterozygous for
this locus.</text></p>
<li>
What is the name for the pattern of inheritance of the phenotypes
encoded by the R and W alleles?
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">This inheritance pattern is
incomplete dominance for flower color because the heterozygotes have a
phenotype that is intermediate between the phenotypes of the two
homozygotes. </text></p>
<li>
Why does the heterozygote have pink flowers instead of red or white?
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">The explanation for why the
heterozygote has pink flowers rather than red or white could be a few
things. One example, maybe the R allele encodes the production of red
pigment and the W allele results in no pigment production. However, one
R allele does not result in enough pigment being produced to give a
darker red color (it’s haplo-insufficient), thus we get a pink color
instead.</text></p>
<li>
Do you make any connections between this example and topics we learned
earlier in the course?
</li>
<text style="background-color:lightcyan">Responses will vary… You should
find some connections! </text>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<li>
<p>As discussed in the content video on Independent Assortment,
phenotypic plasticity is the phenomenon in which a single genotype can
produce different phenotypes, depending on external conditions. For
example, water fleas (<i>Daphnia</i> spp., pictured) are zooplankton,
microscopic aquatic animals commonly found in ponds and lakes. They eat
algae and are eaten by juvenile fish. If a female <i>Daphnia</i> lives
in a pond also inhabited by fish, she will produce clonal babies (by
parthenogenesis) that grow head and tail spikes (on the left in image).
But if that same mom (genetically identical) lives in a pond without
fish, she will have clonal babies with rounded heads and short tails (on
the right in image).</p>
<p><img src="../reference/figures/daphnia.jpg" alt="Photo of two Daphnia individuals, one with a regular round head and one with a long spiky helmet" width="132" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
How do you think <i>Daphnia moms</i> are able to change the way in which
their babies develop to either have or lack head and tail spikes? (Think
about how this relates to previous topics.)
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">Since the babies develop
inside the female <i>Daphnia</i>, they will be able to receive signals
from her (and she will have deposited proteins in the cytoplasm of the
egg cells she produced). These signals could include transcription
factors that cause epigenetic changes in the genomes of the babies so
that they “turn off” the round-head signal cascade and “turn on” the
spiky-head signal cascade. This will be a type of epigenetic change that
results in a permanent change in the babies (they can’t change back to
round-heads if it turns out there aren’t any fish). However, if fish
disappear from the environment, they will send those signals to their
own babies and may have offspring with rounded heads. </text></p>
<li>
Throughout the course, we’ve actually seen quite a few examples of
phenotypic plasticity, though I didn’t give them that name at the time.
Find at least 2 examples that we have used earlier in the course which
also happen to be examples of phenotypic plasticity. See if you can find
one of them in a unicellular organism!
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">Here are some
examples:</text></p>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p><text style="background-color:lightcyan"> From Mitosis and Binary
fission video, the (unicellular) bacterium <i>Caulobacter</i> has two
phenotypes: a flagellated swarmer cell and a stalked cell. The swarmer
cell eventually settles down attached to a surface and switches
phenotypes to be a stalked cell.</text></p></li>
<li><p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">Also in Mitosis and
Binary Fission video, the (unicellular) bacterium <i>Bacillus
licheniformis</i> has two types of cells, vegetative and endospores.
These are phenotypically and metabolically quite different (endospores
can be dormant to survive bad conditions).</text></p></li>
<li><p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">Temperature-dependent
sex determination (like in the red-eared slider turtle, Transcription
video) is another example: which gonads develop depends on the
environmental conditions. So the same exact genome can develop as either
male or female.</text></p></li>
<li><p><text style="background-color:lightcyan"> People who have the HbS
allele for betaglobin have globin molecules that can be the usual
protein complex that floats freely OR under low blood oxygen, their
globin molecules polymerize to make rigid fibers that warp the shape of
the red blood cell (to be a sickle-cell, Translation
video).</text></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<br><p>You are a plant breeder studying two phenotypes in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythronium_americanum" class="external-link">trout lily
plant</a>: flower color and leaf pattern. Your studies lead you to
believe that the flower color phenotype is determined by a single gene
with two alleles (yellow, A, and white, a) and the leaf pattern
phenotype is also determined by a single gene with two alleles (spotted,
B, and plain, b). You have a true-breeding plant that has white flowers
and spotted leaves (aaBB). You do not know the genes that are
responsible for these two phenotypes but have inferred the genotype of
your true-breeding plant with white flowers and spotted leaves.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
A fellow lily-breeder sends you a true-breeding plant that has yellow
flowers and plain leaves. What is the genotype of this plant? (Hint:
what does true-breeding mean?)
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">Let A represent the allele
for yellow flowers and b represent the allele for plain leaves. Then, a
true-breeding plant with yellow flowers and plain leaves must have the
genotype AAbb. </text><br></p>
<li>
You cross your white and spotted plant with the yellow and plain plant.
If yellow is dominant to white and spotted is dominant to plain, what
will be the genotype and phenotype of the offspring (the
F<sub>1</sub>s)?
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">The cross is aaBB × AAbb so
all of the offspring will inherit a white allele and a spotted allele
from one parent and a yellow allele and a plain alllele from the other
parent. Thus, the genotype of all offspring will be AaBb. Since yellow
is dominant to white and spotted is dominant to plain, the phenotype of
these plants will be yellow flowers and spotted leaves. </text><br></p>
<li>
Imagine you wanted to figure out whether the flower color and leaf
pattern genes are linked. What cross would you need to carry out? What
phenotypic ratio would you expect to observe in the cross if the genes
are NOT physically linked? (Hint: You must use the plants you already
have available, which does not include an aabb individual.)
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">To figure out if they are
linked, we should begin by rewriting our genotypes to reflect which
alleles were inherited together from a given parent. The true-breeding
white (a) and spotted (B) parent produces gametes that all have aB while
the true- breeding yellow (A) and plain (b) parent’s gametes are all Ab.
So the F<sub>1</sub> offspring of their cross can be written as aB/Ab to
reflect which alleles came from which parental gamete.</text><br></p>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">To find out if the genes
underlying the two traits are linked, we can cross two of the
F<sub>1</sub> plants, all of which have the genotype aB/Ab. So the cross
would be:</text><br></p>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">AaBb x AaBb</text><br></p>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">Or, if we wanted to show
which alleles were inherited from which parental gamete:</text></p>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">aB/Ab × aB/Ab</text><br></p>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">If the genes for these two
traits are NOT linked, then we could just look at equation (1), without
worrying about which alleles were in which parental gamete. In this case
of NOT linked, we could figure out the offspring distribution for the
two traits separately like so:</text></p>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">For flower color:
</text><br><text style="background-color:lightcyan">25% aa (white), 50%
Aa (yellow), 25% AA (yellow)</text></p>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">For leaf pattern:</text><br><text style="background-color:lightcyan">25% BB (spotted), 50% Bb
(spotted), 25% bb (plain)</text></p>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">We then combine these
probabilities to get the multilocus genotype and phenotype
probabilities. Assuming flower color and leaf pattern segregate
independently (are not linked), the probability of the offspring of our
cross being white flowered with spotted leaves will be the probability
of having white flowers (0.25 or 25%) times the probability of having
spotted leaves (0.25 + 0.50 = 0.75 or 75%) which is 0.25 x 0.75 = 0.1875
or 18.75% (3/16).</text></p>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">Overall, if the genes for
the traits are not linked, we’d expect to observe these phenotype and
genotype frequencies (make the 4 by 4 Punnett square to see these
results):</text></p>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">white, spotted will be
18.75% (3/16) where 1/16 are aaBB and 2/16 are aaBb</text><br></p></li>
<li><p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">white, plain will be
6.25% (1/16) where 1/16 are aabb</text><br></p></li>
<li><p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">yellow, spotted will be
56.25% (9/16) where 1/16 are AABB, 2/16 are AABb, 2/16 are AaBB, and
4/16 are AaBb.</text></p></li>
<li><p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">yellow, plain will be
18.75% (3/16) where 1/16 are AAbb and 2/16 are Aabb.</text></p></li>
</ul>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">In contrast, if the genes
are tightly linked, then the white/spotted alleles will almost always be
inherited together and the yellow/plain alleles will also almost always
be inherited together. In that case, the only types of gametes our
F<sub>1</sub> plants can produce are aB or Ab, in equal frequencies. So,
if we combine them to get our multilocus genotypes and phenotypes, we
get the following expected phenotypic and genotypic ratios for tightly
linked genes:</text></p>
<ul>
<li><p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">white, spotted will be
25% (1/4), all aB/aB </text></p></li>
<li><p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">white, plain will be
absent, 0% because no ab gametes are made </text></p></li>
<li><p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">yellow, spotted will be
50% (2/4), all aB/Ab where either gamete could come from either parent
so this is 50% of the total zygotes created</text></p></li>
<li><p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">yellow, plain will be
25% (1/4), all Ab/Ab</text></p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<li>
If the genes are very closely physically linked, would you ever be able
to produce a true-breeding plant with yellow flowers and spotted leaves?
Explain.
</li>
<text style="background-color:lightcyan">If the genes are VERY closely
physically linked, as described above, then the only way we could ever
produce a true-breeding plant with the phenotype yellow/spotted would be
if crossing-over occurred between the two genes, which would finally
give us gametes that carried yellow/spotted alleles. Otherwise, while we
could produce a plant that was yellow/spotted, only half of its
offspring (crossed with itself) would actually be yellow/spotted because
the plant is heterozygous for both genes. The closer together the genes
are, the less likely this is to happen. </text><p><br></p>
<p>Linkage between genes arises because a single chromosome often
contains a very long sequence of DNA that includes many genes. Given
that humans have an estimated 20-25 thousand genes and n = 23 different
chromosomes (2n = 46), we might expect that each chromosome is likely to
contain around 1000 genes (in fact, some chromosomes only contain a few
dozen genes, others have more than 2000).</p>
<p>Below are models of a few human chromosomes (in condensed form),
noting along the length of the chromosome where different genes are
located for human autosomes 5 through 8. The labeled genes are ones
where some versions (alleles) of that gene are known to cause disease.
The dark bands on the chromosomes indicate areas that are usually
heterochromatin (highly condensed). Use the figure to answer the
following questions.</p>
<p><img src="../reference/figures/linkage2.png" alt="Image of human chromosomes 5-8 showing location of disease related genes" width="430" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
On chromosome 7, the OB gene encodes the hormone leptin, which helps
regulate energy balance (wild-type allele B). The b allele for this gene
produces non-functional leptin molecules which increase risk of obesity
in homozygotes (bb). Based on the figure, the OB (Obesity) gene is
physically linked to which other genes?
</li>
<text style="background-color:lightcyan">The OB gene is closely linked
to CFTR and Pendrin. It is possibly linked, but more distantly, to ELN
and GCK. </text><br><br><li>
Consider the CFTR gene on chromosome 7, which encodes a protein that
transports chloride and thiocyanate ions across the cell membrane
(wild-type allele F). The mutant f allele for this gene is a deletion
that causes protein-misfolding, leading to cystic fibrosis in
homozygotes (ff) but no effect in heterozygotes (Ff). If a person was
heterozygous for both the OB gene and the CFTR gene (BbFf), and the
genes were NOT linked, what would be the chance that this person’s child
would inherit BOTH the b and f alleles from this parent?
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">The parent is BbFf and if
the genes were not linked, we’d expect them to produce equal proportions
of the following 4 gamete types: BF, bf, Bf, and bF. Thus, there is a
25% chance of this parent passing both the b and the f alleles to their
child. </text><br><br></p>
<li>
Because the OB and CFTR genes are linked, we need to think through some
additional information to figure out how this affects the chance of an
offspring inheriting mutant alleles for both genes. Consider 2
scenarios:
</li>
<br><ol type="a">
<li>
Scenario 1: Jack’s parents have the genotypes BBff (mom) and bbFF (dad),
giving Jack the genotype BbFf. If this is Jack’s genotype, and no
crossing-over occurs between the genes, can Jack’s child inherit both
the b and f alleles from Jack? Explain.
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">If Jack is Bf/bF and the
genes are tightly linked so no crossing-over occurs, then Jack will
produce 2 types of gametes: Bf and bF. As a result, Jack CANNOT pass
both b and f to one child. </text><br></p>
<li>
Scenario 2: Alex’s parents have the genotypes bbff (mom) and BBFF (dad),
giving Alex the BbFf genotype. If no crossing-over occurs between OB and
CFTR, can Alex pass on both the b and f alleles to one child?
</li>
<text style="background-color:lightcyan">In this scenario, Alex will
make only bf and BF gametes meaning there is a 50% chance that Alex
passes both the b and f alleles to a child. </text>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<li>
Now consider the children of parents with the genotypes Bf/bF and Bf/bF.
Assuming that these genes are so tightly linked that crossing-over does
not occur between them,
</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>
What’s the chance that their child has a high risk of obesity?
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">We only need to consider the
OB gene here. There is a 50% chance of getting the b allele from each
parent, yielding a 25% chance of the child being at high risk for
obesity. </text></p>
<li>
What’s the chance that their child inherits a predisposition for cystic
fibrosis?
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">Here we need only consider
the CFTR gene. Again, there is a 50% chance of each parent contributing
the f allele to the child, yielding a 25% chance that the child is
predisposed to cystic fibrosis. </text></p>
<li>
What’s the chance that their child is at high risk for both obesity and
cystic fibrosis? How would your response change if the genes were NOT
linked (calculate the probability)?
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">To be at high risk for both
conditions, the child would have to be bbff. In order to get that
genotype, the child would have to inherit bf from both parents. Given
the earlier information on the parents and linkage, it is impossible for
either parent to contribute a bf gamete. Thus, the risk of the child
being bbff is 0% because the obesity-risk allele b is inherited with the
wild-type F allele (leaving the cystic fibrosis causing f allele
inherited with the wild-type B allele).</text></p>
<text style="background-color:lightcyan">What if the genes were not
linked? In that case, we would consider each condition separately and
then combine the probabilities. From parts (i) and (ii) we know the risk
for each condition alone is 25% thus, we can say that the risk of
inheriting both is 0.25 × 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25% (also known as 1/16).
