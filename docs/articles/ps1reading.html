</h2>
<p>The goal of this week’s problem set is to familiarize you with
systematics (the way we name organisms in science) and phylogenetics
(the way we describe how organisms are related to each other). The
content videos will help introduce this material but we’re also
supplying some extra background here.</p>
<p><strong>Biodiversity</strong> refers to the diversity of life on
Earth. In one way or another, everything we study in BIOL 210 involves
biodiversity. Perhaps you are most familiar with biodiversity as the
number of species in a habitat and the relative abundance of each
species. However, biodiversity encompasses much more than these
measures. Early in the semester we will focus on another element of
biodiversity: genetic diversity. Later we will shift attention to
species diversity. Towards the end of the course, we will broaden our
scope of diversity to include the geographic scale of communities,
ecosystems, and biomes.</p>
<p>This problem set is intended to introduce you to Earth’s biodiversity
while simultaneously providing a useful framework for talking about
biodiversity. We will learn that biologists talk about biodiversity in a
<strong>phylogenetic</strong> context; i.e., based on evolutionary
relationships. Thus it is important that in the very first week of the
semester, you become comfortable with reading and interpreting
phylogenetic trees.</p>

<h3 id="a-note-about-taxonomy-and-phylogeny">A note about taxonomy and phylogeny<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-note-about-taxonomy-and-phylogeny"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Taxonomy</strong> is simply another word for classification
system. Biologists have long endeavored to produce reasonable and useful
classification schemes for the world’s biodiversity. Traditional
taxonomic systems are based on the concept of <strong>hierarchical
ranks</strong>; that is, they consist of nested groups. In other words,
each rank may be composed of numerous taxa of the next lowest rank: an
order may consist of several families, a family may consist of several
genera (the plural of genus), and a genus may consist of several
species. The major ranks of the modified <strong>Linnaean
system</strong> of taxonomy we use today are, in descending order:
Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. Linnaeus used
visible characteristics to classify organisms and described only two
kingdoms: plants and animals. However, today we classify organisms in a
Three Domain System (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya), which is based on
anatomical, life-history, and genetic traits.</p>
<p>Note that, when used formally, each rank in the hierarchy is
capitalized, except for the specific epithet, which is in lowercase.
Scientific names are binomials, having two parts. For example, <em>Ulmus
americana</em>, is the species name for American elm. The first name –
<em>Ulmus</em> – is the genus for elms and the second name –
<em>americana</em>, meaning “of America”, is the specific epithet. The
scientific name can be abbreviated as <em>U. americana</em>, but one
cannot use <em>americana</em> alone, as that epithet is also used for
other taxa, such as the white ash, whose species name is <em>Fraxinus
americana</em>. The genus is always capitalized, but the epithet usually
is not. Note that standard scientific nomenclature requires that formal
scientific names are written either in italics or are underlined. YOU
ARE EXPECTED TO USE THE STANDARD FORMAT IN ALL WRITTEN WORK FOR THIS
COURSE.</p>
<p>Prior to the advent of technology for DNA sequencing, taxonomists
primarily used assessments of anatomical similarity as the basis for
defining taxonomic groups. However, as we will see later in the
semester, <strong>morphology</strong> (which is another word for
anatomy) is occasionally misleading - similarity of structure doesn’t
always reflect common evolutionary origins. There is now broad agreement
among taxonomists that classification systems should reflect shared
ancestry, even when morphology contradicts phylogeny. In other words,
taxonomic groups should always correspond to clades. Consequently,
understanding phylogeny is now a critical prerequisite to defining
taxonomic groups.</p>

<h3 id="how-are-organisms-related-and-how-do-we-depict-these-relationships">How are organisms related and how do we depict these
relationships?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-are-organisms-related-and-how-do-we-depict-these-relationships"></a>
</h3>
<p>Currently available evidence suggests that all life on Earth shares a
single origin; i.e. every living thing on the planet descends from a
single common ancestor that lived around 4 billion years ago. That
long-ago ancestor then split into descendant species (a process called
<b>speciation</b>), which themselves split over and over and over again
forming the millions of species on Earth today. Along the way, these
species were altered by evolutionary processes such as natural selection
and genetic drift, which you will learn about later in the semester.
Remember that evolution is nothing more than <b>the change in genetic
structure of populations over time and space.</b></p>
<p>How do we depict these genealogical relationships among species, in
visual or diagrammatic form? The evolutionary relationships among
different species are called phylogenetic relationships, and are
typically depicted as a branching diagram referred to as a
<b>cladogram</b>, a <b>phylogenetic tree</b>, or simply a
<b>phylogeny</b> (all of these words are interchangeable for our
purposes). An example phylogeny of different species of oak trees is
given on the <a href="sheets/sci_articles/Oak.Phylogeny.Worksheet.pdf">Oak Phylogeny
Sheet handout</a>. We’ll be referring to this sheet a bit so make sure
you keep it open or download it. Let’s take a few minutes to figure out
what is implied by a phylogeny and how to read one.</p>
<p>First of all, how do we read a phylogeny? Go to the <a href="sheets/sci_articles/Oak.Phylogeny.Worksheet.pdf">Oak Phylogeny
Sheet</a> and look at Tree 1. Find the white oak in Tree 1. If you
follow the line leading from the white oak, it intersects with the line
leading to the bur oak. The point at which these lines intersect is
called a <b>node</b> (in this case, it’s referred to as node C; all the
nodes are assigned a letter in this tree), and this node represents the
last shared ancestor of the bur oak and white oak. (The lines themselves
are referred to as <b>branches</b>; after all, it’s a phylogenetic
“tree”, right?) So, this phylogeny implies that the bur oak and white
oak share a common ancestor with each other more recently than with any
other group on the tree, and we thus refer to the bur oak and white oak
as <b>sister species</b>. Another way of thinking about this
relationship is that the bur oak and white oak are each other’s closest
relatives.</p>
<p>It is extremely important to realize that phylogenies imply time in
addition to relationships. In other words, the groups you are actually
examining or discussing (the <b>terminal taxa</b>) are placed at the
tips of the branches, and as you follow the branches all the way to the
<b>root</b> of the tree (the root represents the common ancestor of all
the species in the tree), you are traveling backwards in time. How much
time has elapsed between nodes, you might ask? Well, in a simple
cladogram such as the one you see above, the absolute amount of time is
not specified; only relative time is implied (i.e., the ancestor at node
B must have lived before the ancestor at node C, but how much earlier is
impossible to say using this tree alone). Generally, inferring the
absolute amount of time elapsed between nodes requires additional
external data, such as fossils which are dated geologically. DNA
sequence data can also help us estimate time using what is known as a
“molecular clock” - but this STILL requires the existence of fossils to
calibrate the clock.</p>
<p>Now let’s take some time to practice reading trees. Look at Tree 1 on
the Oak Phylogeny Sheet and use it to answer the following questions.
These questions are also part of your Problem Set 1 questions so be sure
to keep your answers for that assignment!</p>
<ul>
<li>
List the terminal taxon or taxa (in this case, species) identified by
their most recent common ancestor, that are sister to each oak below.
</li>
</ul>
<ol type="a">
<li>
northern red oak is sister to…
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</ol>
<br><li>
TRUE / FALSE Swamp white oak is most closely related to bur oak. Briefly
explain your answer.

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="rearranging-branches-on-trees">Rearranging branches on trees<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#rearranging-branches-on-trees"></a>
</h3>
<p>When reading trees, keep in mind that what matters is how the
branches connect to the nodes. It is possible to rearrange the order of
the branches on a tree WITHOUT changing the way the branches attach to
each other. These rearranged trees may at first glance look much
different than the original, but in fact they depict identical
relationships.</p>
<p>Refer back to the <a href="sheets/sci_articles/Oak.Phylogeny.Worksheet.pdf">Oak Phylogeny
Sheet</a>, and find Trees A, B, and C. Each of these three trees has the
same species as in Tree 1, but the relationships among them are
different; i.e. at least some of the relationships differ in each of
these three trees. However, ONE of the three shows the <em>exact
same</em> relationships as in Tree 1. Which one?</p>
<p>Now let’s add one more wrinkle to reading trees. There are many ways
that phylogenies can be drawn, but they all depict the same thing—the
evolutionary relationships among taxa. Two frequently encountered
alternative ways of drawing cladograms are provided as Trees D and E at
the bottom of the Oak Phylogeny Sheet. <strong>Don’t be fooled by the
different shapes or by what seem to be extra branches in these
depictions</strong>—they still show relationships among species. For
example, look at node C in Trees D and E. Node C shows the same sister
relationship between white oak and bur oak that is depicted in Tree 1
(convince yourself of this fact). In Trees D and E, there is still just
one branch leading from node C to white oak; the branch simply makes a
90 ° turn along the way!</p>
<p>Trees D and E depict identical relationships; they also depict
identical relationships with respect to EITHER Tree A, B, or C. Which
one of these three trees are Trees D and E identical to?</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="taxa-and-clades">Taxa and clades<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#taxa-and-clades"></a>
</h3>
<p>Now, let’s move on to a couple other items. First, an important note:
trees don’t have to have species as the organisms at the tips. We can
depict the relationships among larger taxonomic groups in exactly the
same way as we do individual species. For example, we could show the
phylogenetic relationships among the orders of mammals (i.e. branch tips
would be labeled “Rodents”, “Primates”, “Carnivorans”, etc. instead of
individual species names). For this reason, we can use the catch-all
term <b>taxon</b> (plural is <b>taxa</b>) to refer to any organisms at
the tips of a phylogeny. Taxon can refer to any named taxonomic group;
e.g. a species is a taxon, a genus is a taxon, an order is a taxon,
etc.</p>
<p>Second, another important term to become familiar with is
<b>clade</b> (which, in fact, is the root word for cladogram). A clade
is entirely composed of an ancestor (i.e. a node) and all of its
descendants (even those descendants not labelled on the tree). For
example, in Tree 1, the group containing node C, its descendant taxa
white oak and bur oak, and the branches leading from C to the terminal
taxa forms a clade, as does the group containing node B and all its
descendants. The latter clade happens to contain the clade defined by
node C; in other words, one clade can contain within it many other
clades (another way to say this is that clades are nested). Keep in mind
that a clade is defined by common ancestry, but we identify (or
diagnose) clades by traits the organisms share. Definition and diagnosis
are different processes, so be sure that you do not confuse them.</p>
<p>One important note to keep in mind about terminal taxa is that when
we write “white oak”, for example, we are referring to the group of all
white oaks that exist today, everyone making up that species. When we
represent that tip of the tree we are thus representing the common
ancestor of all oaks plus all the oaks that descended from that common
ancestor. This means that every species is also a clade. You can think
of the very tip of the tree as being the node that represents the taxon
listed at the terminus.</p>
<p>Now let’s practice taxa and clades—look at Tree 1 on the <a href="sheets/sci_articles/Oak.Phylogeny.Worksheet.pdf">Oak Phylogeny
Sheet</a> and answer the following questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Which terminal taxa are in the clade that is defined by node E?
</li>
<br><li>
Now find all of the clades in Tree 1. How many are there? List them,
using the node to define the clade (so clade defined by node A would be
everything on the tree). (Remember that the clade is defined by an
ancestor and all of its descendants, so all should be contained in the
grouping.)
</li>
<br><li>
Below are several groups of taxa, some of which form clades in Tree 1
and others of which do not. Place an X next to each group of taxa below
that collectively form a clade in Tree 1.
<ol type="a">
<li>
white oak, bur oak, swamp white oak, Node B, and all of its descendants
</li>
<li>
southern red oak, post oak, overcup oak, Node K, and all of its
descendants
</li>
<li>
black oak, northern red oak, shumard oak and all of Node I’s descendants
</li>
<li>
northern red oak, pin oak, southern red oak, and Node H
</li>
<li>
post oak, overcup oak
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="understanding-trait-evolution-on-phylogenetic-trees">Understanding trait evolution on phylogenetic trees<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#understanding-trait-evolution-on-phylogenetic-trees"></a>
</h3>
<p>Now that we have some practice reading phylogenetic trees, let’s try
adding taxa to a tree while learning about how to “map” traits onto a
phylogeny.</p>
<p>Find the <a href="sheets/sci_articles/tolblank.pdf">Tree of Life
Sheet</a>, which depicts a phylogeny of some of the major groups of
organisms on Earth. However, the taxa names are blank! You will be
adding in these taxon names using the list of taxa and the information
on the tree about characters to identify which are which. You’ll
probably also need to do some googling to sleuth out the answers!</p>
<p>But first, let’s get familiarized with placing trait values on trees.
You will notice that superimposed on top of many branches in the Tree of
Life are hatch marks labeled trait names. These hatch marks indicate the
branches on which certain traits evolved, either appearing (the trait
has newly evolved) or disappearing (the trait has been lost). These
marks are an example of <b>character mapping</b>, or “mapping” the
branch of origin of certain “characters”, which is just another word for
trait. Let’s look at an example close to home—-find the letter that
corresponds to the presence of mammary glands. Of course, you can guess
which taxon is attached to this branch—-none other than mammals. This
hatch mark means that mammary glands evolved at some point along the
branch leading to mammals, but AFTER the split with its nearest
relatives (who do not have mammary glands). It also implies that all
mammals have mammary glands since this trait evolved BEFORE the earliest
evolutionary splits between mammal groups (these splits aren’t shown
because all mammals are treated as a single group in this tree).</p>
<p>Now let’s practice interpreting trait evolution on phylogenetic
trees—-use the <a href="sheets/sci_articles/tolblank.pdf">Tree of Life
sheet</a> to answer the following questions (you don’t need to know the
taxon names to answer these questions). <b>ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS BEFORE
FILLING IN THE TAXON NAMES</b>. These questions will help familiarize
you with the tree prior to filling in the names.</p>
<ul>
<li>How many taxa on this tree possess vertebrae?</li>
<li>Find the branch where “segmentation” evolved. Is this trait present
in all of the descendants of this ancestor?</li>
<li>On the Tree of Life sheet, which taxa have alternation of
generations but lack vascular tissue?</li>
<li>Which taxa on the tree are segmented but lack a collagen
cuticle?</li>
</ul>

<p>On the Tree of Life Worksheet, we furnished you with the information
about where certain traits evolved. But—-and this is extremely
important-—it is also possible to infer where traits evolved if given a
tree and information about the traits possessed by the taxa at the tips
of the branches. So, if we can determine the phylogenetic relationships
among taxa, then we will be able to make inferences about trait
evolution.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a straightforward example of this process in our
original oak example. Go to Tree 1 on the <a href="sheets/sci_articles/Oak.Phylogeny.Worksheet.pdf">Oak Phylogeny
Sheet</a> and answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you notice how some of the oak species have leaves whose tips
are pointy (e.g., blackjack oak, northern red oak, pin oak), while other
species have smooth lobes instead (e.g., chestnut oak, white oak, post
oak, overcup oak)? Note which taxa have pointed tips.</li>
<li>How many times did pointed tips evolve in oaks, given the leaves and
relationships you see in this tree?</li>
<li>On which branch do you think pointed tips evolved? You can describe
it by saying which nodes the branch is between. Remember that characters
typically evolve along branches, not right at nodes.</li>
<li>Did the ancestor of all oaks have pointy or smooth lobes? In other
words, which of these traits was ancestral?</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<p>Part of the point of filling out the tree is to learn more about some
of the major groups of organisms on Earth. You will probably need to use
the internet or reference books to help you figure out this puzzle.
Below is the list of taxa that are included on the tree, in alphabetical
order. Your job is to figure out which taxon numbers on the <a href="sheets/sci_articles/tolblank.pdf">Tree of Life sheet</a>
correspond to which actual taxon. In addition to matching up taxon
numbers with names, you should provide (1) an example species that
belongs to that taxon group and (2) a description of what trait or
traits help us to identify that group. For example, earlier we learned
that mammals are the only ones with mammary glands. The example of
mammals is filled in for you in the table below.</p>
<p>It is extremely important to keep in mind that the branches on a
cladogram may represent up to tens or even hundreds of millions of years
of time. For example, on the Tree of Life sheet, the branch separating
plants with alternation of generations from its nearest relative
represents 300-500 million years of evolution. Of course, there is no
way to tell that just by looking at this tree; it’s just a cladogram,
after all—it only depicts relationships, not the amount of time that has
elapsed. The point here is that a huge amount of evolutionary change
could have occurred on any of the branches of this tree. We are simply
showing where some key, diagnostic traits appeared relative to when
lineages split.</p>
