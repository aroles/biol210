</h2>
<ol>
<li>
How do innate behaviors differ from learned behaviors? Does a behavior
have to be only innate or only learned? Can there be intermediates?
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">Innate behaviors are those in which no
experience with the stimulus is required for the organism to exhibit the
‘correct’ response on the very first exposure. A learned behavior is one
in which the organism does not give the optimal response the first time
it experiences the stimulus, instead the organism will change its
behavior over time, as it gains experience with the stimulus and the
consequences of its response. Learned behaviors require experience but
not necessarily observing others.</text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">There can certainly be intermediates between
innate and learned responses. Or some parts of a complex behavior could
be innate while other parts might be learned. For example, many
organisms that care for their newborn offspring innately know how to
take care of their babies BUT many organisms also get better at caring
for offspring as they gain experience with it. For example, a number of
birds have a lower rate of survival of their chicks for the very first
clutch and then a higher rate for the second clutch and perhaps higher
still for the third clutch.</text><br></p>

Watch <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sKbFbXQGXggcvI9GS5C8hOQqk_eoHXUp/view?usp=sharing" class="external-link">Video
1: Life of Insects</a> (about 8 minutes).
</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Identify a stimulus and response of the ants. What types of
communication and signals are being used in this behavior?
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">Stimuli might include the appearance or
smell of the seed. (So visual, chemical, and maybe tactile signals.) A
response to the stimulus is to pick it up and take it back to the next
(treat it like food).</text><br></p>
<li>
Given the stimulus or signal you just described, give a proximate
explanation for how the stimulus leads to the response.
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">A proximate explanation here would be that
the sight or smell of the seed is perceived by the ant, processed in the
brain and recognized as familiar (this is food), and then the signals
are sent to respond by picking it up and returning it to the
nest.</text><br></p>
<li>
Reflecting on the segment about the beetle larvae and the digger bees,
do you think the behavior of the larvae is innate or learned? Explain
your reasoning.
</li>
<text style="color:blue">Given that the beetle larvae have not had any
experience with the stimuli nor the opportunity to observe this
behavior, the response of the beetle larvae must be innate.</text>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<li>
Watch <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qK6vGh5F5TpWNh7iBxNE5sKAStEn3m8F/view?usp=sharing" class="external-link">Video
2: Wild crows in the city</a> (about 2 minutes). In this video, is the
behavior of the crows innate or learned? Explain your reasoning.
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">The behavior of the crows in this video is
learned. They do not initially know that cars running over the nut will
crack it. Nor do they know at the start that using the cross-walk will
be safer! In fact, they have probably even learned to fly high and drop
the nut on a hard surface. It is experience, and possibly observing the
behavior of other crows, that has taught them what works. Interestingly,
we might consider whether a tendency for curiosity and trying things out
might be an innate feature of crow-ness…</text><br></p>
<li>
Why might some behaviors be learned and others be innate? That is, can
you think of what conditions are likely to favor a behavior being innate
versus conditions that are likely to favor a learned behavior?
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">A behavior which must be done correctly the
first time it is needed in order for an organism to survive is likely to
be largely innate. Meanwhile, when what you encounter in the environment
might be somewhat unpredictable, then it may be favorable to have
learned behaviors, as they are able to adjust to the circumstances that
the organism faces.</text><br></p>
<li>
In thinking about how birdsong develops (see the short reading under
Learning), which aspects of the process do you think involve innnate
responses? Which aspects do you think involve learned responses? What is
the role of genetics? Of environment?
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">The response of making vocalizations at all
is likely to be innnate. But the development of a structure to those
vocalizations such that a song is produced is likely to involve learning
(under normal conditions). In the reading, the example for this is the
experiment showing that chaffinches raised without exposure to adult
males still sing but their songs are considered abnormal (this would be
an innate response). The fact that chicks exposed to recordings of
chaffinch song develop normal songs demonstrates a learned
aspect.</text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">Genetics has a role to play in both innate
and learned behaviors as the genome encodes the proteins that are
important in perceiving stimuli and generating a response. The example
in the reading about birdsong is the FOXP2 gene, which is a
transcription factor, turning on or off other genes. Genes like FOXP2
are important in building the neural circuitry that allows an organism
to respond innately to a stimulus or to learn a response to a
stimulus.</text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">One way in which the environment can be
crucial with learned responses involves the idea that organisms
sometimes can only learn certain behaviors at very particular times in
their growth and maturation. In some birds, there is a brief window
where song is learned while in others, new songs can be learned
throughout life. Thus, the environmental exposures experienced during
those critical windows has a huge influence on the response the organism
learns to produce.</text><br></p>
<li>
Consider how we know that there is a genetic basis to a behavior. Read
Sullivan (2005) about the genetics of schizophrenia (5 pages). For
example, consider the mental illness schizophrenia whose symptoms can
include altered perceptions (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), loss of
interest/motivation/enjoyment in daily life, and cognitive symptoms
(e.g., reduced attention, concentration, memory).
</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Describe the quantitative evidence that supports a genetic basis for
schizophrenia. What patterns or observations suggest that genotype
influences whether or not some- one develops schizophrenia?
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">A number of pieces of evidence suggest a
genetic basis:</text></p>
</ol>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p><text style="color:blue">Much higher risk of developing
schizophrenia if a close relative has it (family history is a risk
factor).</text></p></li>
<li><p><text style="color:blue">High heritability (81%), determined by
comparing monozygotic vs. dizygotic twins.</text></p></li>
<li><p><text style="color:blue">Adoption studies demonstrate increased
risk of schizophrenia if biological parent has it but not if adoptive
parent does.</text></p></li>
<li><p><text style="color:blue">Many GWAS studies have identified
genomic locations where genotype appears to correlate with
presence/absence of schizophrenia. However, few genomic regions are
repeatedly identified by multiple studies, making it difficult to draw
broad conclusions. This approach is limited by sample sizes, the size of
effect of particular genes (effects can be small), and interactions with
environmental risk factors.</text><br></p></li>
</ul>
<li>
On the flip side, what patterns or observations tell us that genotype is
not the ONLY factor influencing disease risk for schizophrenia?
</li>
<text style="color:blue">Examining Figure 1, we can see that while
family history is the largest risk factor for schizophrenia, a variety
of environmental factors can also increase risk. Central nervous system
damage of newborns has an odds ratio of 7, and infection with rubella
has an odds ratio around 5. Meanwhile, we can see that the mother’s
environment also matters: prenatal bereavement increases risk with an
odds ratio of 6. Other factors increasing maternal stress (famine,
flood) have smaller impacts on risk. We can guess that these
environmental factors are likely to influence gene expression,
especially early on in development, such as the newborn period. Thus,
methods that can query the epigenetic state of genes may shed some light
on how environmental factors can induce schizophrenia, perhaps even
absent any genetic risk factors (disease-causing alleles).</text>
