<ol>
<li>
Consider the processes of cell reproduction.
</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>
How is cell division similar and different in prokaryotic and
eukaryotice cells?
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan"> In both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cells, the basic steps are the same: (1) a copy of the
genetic information is created in preparation for cell reproduction (and
various other cellular materials are produced that will be divided
between the daughter cells); (2) The genetic info and other cell
contents are segregated (separated) into 2 pools; (3) a membrane is
formed to separate the two pools into separate cytoplasms, each with
their own plasma membrane – the two daughter cells. As for
differences…</text></p>
</ol>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<text style="background-color:lightcyan"> In eukaryotes, linear
chromosomes are organized such that each daughter cell receives a copy
of each chromosome and not a random subset of all chromosomes. In
contract, prokaryotes that have a single circular major chromosome do
not require this added organization. For what it’s worth, archaeans may
have linear or circular chromosomes but so far do not seem to have the
organized process of mitosis, rather some archaeans have a random
division of genetic material. In this case, they may have many copies of
each different chromosome so that daughter cells are likely to end up
with at least one copy of each unique chromosome.</text>
</li>
<li>
<text style="background-color:lightcyan"> The eukaryotic nucleus also
necessitates additional steps compared to prokaryotes as the nucleus
must be dissolved to allow for segregation of genetic material and then
later reconsituted around the new daughter cell’s genetic info.</text>
</li>
<li>
<text style="background-color:lightcyan"> Eukaryotes may do cellular
reproduction either via mitosis or meiosis. Mitosis maintains ploidy
(haploid to haploid OR diploid to diploid) while meiosis reduces ploidy
from diploid in the parent cell to haploid in the daughter cells.
Prokaryotes are considered haploid and thus do not undergo ploidy
changes.</text>
</li>
<li>
<text style="background-color:lightcyan"> Prokaryotes may employ binary
fission but sometimes the result of this is genetically identical but
phenotypically different daughter cells (for example, in Caulobacter).
Eukaryotes can also produce phenotypically different daughter cells
(asymmetric cell division), but the types of cell phenotypes vary
depending on which prokaryote or eukaryote (and which cell types, if a
eukaryote).</text>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<li>
What do you predict might happen if the spindle fibers did not form
during mitosis in a eukaryotic cell?
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">Spindle fibers are important
in moving chromosomes and separating sister chromatids, pulling them to
opposite poles. If they did not form, that could severely interfere with
allocating the genetic information so that each cell has one copy of
each chromosome. Instead, you could end up with some daughter cells
having an extra copy of some chromosomes while lacking others entirely.
Thus, malfunctioning spindle fibers would probably cause mutations in
chromosome numbers and copies per cell.</text></p>
<li>
What do you predict might happen in a prokaryotic cell if a protein
important in constricting the plasma membrane and cell wall during
cytokinesis was non-functional?
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">If a prokaryotic cell had a
malfunctioning protein during cytokinesis, then we might end up with
only a single daughter cell with two copies of the genetic information.
This would be a genome duplication event. </text></p>

<p><br></p>
<li>
<p>In the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, a new zygote is
created when sperm fertilize eggs inside the female parent’s oviduct.
The sperm and eggs are haploid, the products of meiosis, while the new
zygote is diploid. The female parent then lays the fertilized egg
(zygote) on a suitable food source. Eggs are white, ovoid, and about 0.5
mm long. About 21 hours after they are laid, eggs hatch and the larvae
emerge. The larvae develop in stages known as instars, which are common
to many insect species. The newly emerged larvae, known as the first
instar, are voracious eaters. They are tiny and difficult to see with
the naked eye. The larvae grow rapidly, and within about two days, the
first instar will molt into the second instar. These larvae will eat,
grow, and molt again to become the third instar. After the third instar
crawls out of the food and onto the surface, the larvae begin to pupate.
In the pupal stage, the larval body shortens and the cuticle hardens and
becomes pigmented, developing into the pupal case. Metamorphosis occurs
within the pupal case; dormant localized tissues that originated during
the embryonic stages develop into their adult forms, while the remaining
larval tissue is broken down to furnish both raw material and the energy
needed for adult development. After three days, the adult emerges. The
adult flies reach sexual maturity and begin producing new gametes about
eight hours after emerging from the pupae, and then the cycle can begin
again.</p>

meiosis is occurring:</b></p>

<li>
On meiosis.
</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>
What are three ways in which meiosis differs from mitosis?
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">There are more than three
ways to describe the differences so I’ll list some of them
here:</text></p>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<text style="background-color:lightcyan">Meiosis occurs only in diploid
(or higher ploidy) cells and produces daughter cells that are haploid.
Mitosis can occur in cells of any ploidy but the daughter cells have the
same ploidy as the parent cell. </text>
</li>
<li>
<text style="background-color:lightcyan">In meiosis, homologous
chromosomes undergo synapsis, allowing for crossing-over between
chromatids, thus possibly producing new genetic combinations of
information. In mitosis, homologous chromosomes do not pair up and thus
do not undergo recombination. </text>
</li>
<li>
<text style="background-color:lightcyan">In meiosis, there are two
rounds of segregation that occur: (1) separation of homologous pairs and
(2) separation of sister chromatids. There’s only one in mitosis:
separation of sister chromatids. </text>
</li>
<li>
<text style="background-color:lightcyan">The starting state of diploid
cells is the same for mitosis and meiosis: there are pairs of replicated
homologous chromosomes. However, the end state is different b/c mitosis
here yields 2 diploid daughter cells while meiosis yields 4 haploid
daughter cells. </text>
</li>
<li>
<text style="background-color:lightcyan">Meiosis produces genetically
unique daughter cells, different from the parent cell. Mitosis produces
genetically identical daughter cells, same as the parent cell. </text>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
What two processes during meiosis result in genetically unique daughter
cells? Explain how they create genetically variable daughter cells.
</li>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">1. Crossing-over during
prophase I, occurring between chromatids of replicated homologous pairs.
This produces unique (compared to parent) combinations of genetic
material in a chromatid as chromatids exchange pieces. This is variation
in the composition of individual chromosomes.</text></p>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">2. Independent Assortment
during Metaphase I, where which chromosome of a homologous pair faces
which pole is randomized. That is, all the chromosomes inherited from
one parent do not just line up together, ending up all at one pole after
anaphase (this can happen but the chances are small when you have lots
of chromosomes). </text></p>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">You might have listed
segregation during anaphase I but to me this really only has the effect
it does because of (2) above… it’s the polarity of pairs that determines
what the composition of the daughter cell will be. </text></p>

<p>Among the related readings are a couple of chapters from Gathering
Moss (The Advantages of Being Small and Back to the Pond). In Back to
the Pond, Kimmerer talks about the moss life cycle, which is different
from that of vascular plants. Check out the graphic of a moss life cycle
from Biology 2e (<a href="https://openstax.org/books/biology-2e/pages/25-3-bryophytes" class="external-link">link</a>).
Note that mosses belong to a group called the bryophytes. Then examine
the image below.</p>
What can you tell me about the parts of the moss life cycle that are
visible to you in this image? How do moss life cycles differ from those
of vascular plants such as angiosperms and gymnosperms?
</li>
<p><img src="../reference/figures/moss2.png" alt="Image of a single chromatid" width="345" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">In this image, we can see
the leafy green part of the moss, which is the mature haploid
gametophyte part of the moss. We can also see some stalks with a capsule
on top – those are the diploid moss sporophyte. Inside of the capsules
is where meiosis occurs to produce haploid spores (which will go on to
grow into leafy green gametophytes). So, we can see that the diploid
stage of mosses is totally reliant on the haploid stage for nutrients
and support, it cannot live on its own. Meanwhile, the leafy green
gametophyte stage will mature to produce gametes (eggs or sperm) using
mitosis. Fertilization of eggs on the moss gametophyte then leads to the
growth of that diploid sporophyte. </text></p>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">Difference: In moss, the
“plant body” that we think of is haploid (it’s haploid-dominant). The
diploid (sporophyte) depends on the haploid for sustenance. This is the
opposite of familiar plants like angiosperms, gymnosperms, or ferns
which are diploid-dominant. </text></p>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">Similarity: In plants,
gametes (eggs, sperm) are produced by mitosis not meiosis. The product
of meiosis is a spore, not a gamete. </text></p>
<p><text style="background-color:lightcyan">Similarity: Moss and other
plants have multicellular bodies both as haploids and as diploids (this
is known as alternation of generations). </text></p>
<text style="background-color:lightcyan">Similar and Different: In
mosses, ferns, and some gymnosperms, the sperm are motile – they have
flagella and swim to the egg. But in angiosperms, the sperm cells aren’t
able to move themselves. Other cells in the pollen carry the sperm cell
to the egg cell (or ovule). The species with motile sperm all require
water to enable fertilization while those with non-motile sperm have
evolved mechanisms independent of water. </text>
