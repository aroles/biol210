</h2>
<p>We’ve covered biological sex determination in a content video,
including the idea that we distinguish between somatic and sex
chromosomes. Note that somatic chromosomes are also called autosomes.
Some ways somatic and sex chromosomes differ are that the sexes have
differing sets of sex chromosomes and the two sex chromosomes do not
contain all of the same genetic information as each other (some genes
are shared but most are found only on one of the two sex chromosomes).
Consider an organism with ZZ/ZW sex determination, where ZZ are male and
ZW are female – this is what birds and some other animals do.</p>
We can see that there appears to be a difference in copy number (aka
dosage) for ZW individuals:
<ul>
<li>
ZW and ZZ have 2 copies of all genes on the autosomes.
</li>
<li>
ZW have only 1 copy of genes on Z or W.
</li>
<li>
ZZ have 2 copies of Z genes and 0 copies of W genes.
</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, for genes found only on Z or only on W, the ZW organism only
has one version but for all of the autosomes (like Chromosome 1), the
same organism has two copies of every gene. This suggests that when
there are sex chromosomes, an organism must have some way to deal with
this difference in dosage, some mechanism of <b>dosage compensation</b>.
Remember from thinking about the BarH1 gene that the number of copies of
a gene can impact the phenotype, it can change gene expression such as
by increasing the amount of transcript produced (and thus possibly the
amount of protein).</p>
<ol>
<li>
Considering what you have learned about transcription and translation,
suggest 2 different mechanisms by which gene expression can be altered
to achieve similar levels of protein production in ZZ and ZW
individuals, for a gene found on the Z chromosome. (Note that telling me
“chromatin state could be altered” is not sufficient.) Remember the
alternative splicing case study where we discussed things like this!
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">Multiple possiblities exist, here are a
few.</text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">In order to equalize gene expression, a ZZ
individual could highly methylate the histones of one Z, which would
greatly reduce or prevent gene expression from that chromosome (this
would be like the Barr body in human females).</text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">Alternatively, the ZW individual could
enhance expression of the genes on their single Z, perhaps producing
extra transcription factors to bind enhancers and in- crease expression
of individual genes.</text></p>
<text style="color:blue">Another possibility is that the ZZ individual
could reduce transcription on both of its Zs so that it matches the
amount of transcription from just one Z.</text><br>
</ol>
<p>In humans, it turns out that having an extra or a missing sex
chromosome often has few effects, compared to having an extra or missing
autosome. In fact, for 1 in every 1000 live births, the newborn is
either XXX (“female”) or XYY (“male”). Such individuals experience
typical physical and mental development expected for XX or XY; they may
never know of the extra chromosome unless they are karyotyped for some
other reason. These individuals are also fertile, producing typical
haploid gametes possessing only a single sex chromosome (their children
do not inherit their condition). <br></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
The question before us is: what happens with gene expression that
results in XXX and XYY individuals being just like XX or XY individuals?
Propose an explanation for the lack of phenotypic effects of each
karyotype, XXX and XYY (the reasons are likely to be different…).
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">For the XXX individual, remember that XX
individuals already shut down one X by forming a Barr body
(X-inactivation). In the case of triple-X, two of the X’s form Barr
bodies. This would result in the usual phenotypic expression of just one
X.</text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">For the XYY individual, it could be that
genes on the extra Y are expressed but there aren’t that many genes on
the Y-chromosome (only 55) and overexpression of them may just not have
that much of an effect. In fact, the National Human Genome Research
Institute says that as they age, many men lose the Y chromosome from
their cells, without apparent problems.</text><br></p>
<li>
Furthermore, given that the parents of XYY or XXX were XX and XY, what
happened during meiosis to yield a YY or XX gamete (thus giving XXX or
XYY zygotes)? (Or you can consider: what happens in meiosis to result in
the triploid individual producing typical haploid gametes, X or Y?)
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">The problem in cell division is most likely
to have happened during gamete formation in one of the parents.
Alternatively, it could occur during very early embryonic development
(and thus be present in most of that person’s cells).</text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">Assuming the event occurred during meiosis,
for an individual to have XYY, the gamete from their father must have
been YY (since females generally have no Y chromosome). For an
individual to have XXX, the gamete from one parent must have been XX
(possibly either parent since both carry X). This can happen when there
is non-disjunction during meiosis I or meiosis II.</text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">If during meiosis I, the homologous pairs
would fail to separate and both end up in the same daughter cell,
yielding 2 daughter cells with 2 copies of the chromosome and 2 with no
copies at the end of the process.</text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">If during meiosis II, sister chromatids fail
to separate and you may have 2 regular hap- loid daughter cells and 2
that are aneuploid (one cell with 2 copies of the chromosome and one
cell with no copies).</text><br></p>
<li>
Consider Mendel’s Law of Segregation. What observations of his led him
to the idea of segregation? What actually happens during meiosis that
explains the patterns Mendel observed in pea plants?
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">Mendel observed that when parents with
different phenotypes had offspring, sometimes one of the parental
phenotypes seemed to disapear in the immediate offspring (F1 generation)
but then might reappear in the F<sub>2</sub> generation, like white
flower color. This led him to suggest that the factor causing white
flower color and the factor causing purple flower color remained
distinct from each other. They didn’t meld together to make something
new, rather each version maintained its own integrity and could thus
reappear intact in a later generation. Now we know that segregation of
factor, or chromosomes, occurs during anaphase I of meiosis, when
homologous pairs of chromosomes are separated from each other. This also
happens to be the point at which the daughter cells become haploid. As a
result of segregation, each gamete (egg or sperm) carries only 1 copy of
the flower color gene, either the purple allele or the white
allele.</text><br></p>
<li>
From Epigenetics: Provide one genetic and one epigenetic explanation for
an individual having increased risk of obesity. If we are doing an
experiment, for example with rats or mice, how can we distinguish
between an individual that is obese due primarily to genetic factors and
one that is obese due primarily to epigenetic factors? Consider what
variables you need to control to tell whether a difference is due to
genetics compared to due to the environment influencing epigenetics.
</li>
<text style="color:blue">Many potential reasonable responses. It’s
important to figure out how you can tell the difference between
organisms being different due to genetic differences versus due to
epigenetic (environment-induced) differences. So, it might be good to
have multiple genotypes and multiple environmental conditions (such as a
control diet versus one that is thought to lead to obesity). If
organisms with the same genotype differ in their propensity to obesity
depending on diet, that strongly implicates a role for epigenetic
effects on obesity. If genotypes differ in obesity risk even when in the
same environment (same diet), that suggests a role for genetic variation
in the risk of obesity.</text><br>
