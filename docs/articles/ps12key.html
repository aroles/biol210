Refer to one or more of the following readings from Gathering Moss to
answer the following questions. Gathering Moss readings are: In the
Forest of the Waterbear; Choices; Portrait of Splachnum.
</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Provide 3 examples of non-competitive interspecific interactions that
are described in the moss readings. Identify the type of interaction
(e.g., commensalism? predation? parasitism?) and which organisms play
which roles in the interaction.
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">Lots of possible responses
here!</text><br></p>
<li>
How would you describe the niche of a moss? Does it vary for different
species of mosses?
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">This is most clearly covered in the Portrait
of Splachnum chapter; what follows is my response but yours may vary!
Mosses can live in very cold places and some very hot places but only if
there’s enough water (at least periodically). Many species can survive
drought periods in a dormant state and then perk up again when water
becomes available. They can’t compete with faster growing angiosperms or
gymnosperms but can grow in places with fewer nutrients than most of
those competitors. Some mosses are generalists, growing in a wide
variety of habitats and conditions while others are specialists, such as
the Splachnum ampullulaceum species described in this chapter. Splachnum
requires the dung of particular deer species in order to germinate
spores, having a preference for “animal nitrogen”. This species then
also requires the help of a fly to transport its spores to new dung
piles. So yes, the specifics of the niche do differ for different moss
species!</text><br></p>
<li>
In these readings from Gathering Moss, do you notice any connections to
other topics we’ve covered this semester?

<text style="color:blue">Lots of possible responses here!</text>

<p><br></p>
<li>
As described in the content video on Competition, in Gauss’ experiments
with competition in Paramecium, the same species always drove the other
to extinction. Why is this consistent result expected from competition
theory?
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">Each species has its own specific resource
needs and efficiency in acquiring and using those resources. Along with
that, that means each different species will have its own carrying
capacity (K) for a given environment, containing particular amounts of
the resources it needs. As a result, when two species need the same
resources but one of them is able to grow more on the same amount of
resource (higher resource-use efficiency), then we expect that the more
efficient user of resources (more individuals per unit resource per unit
time) will “win” in competition. As long as conditions remain the same,
we always expect this interaction to end the same way. HOWEVER, if the
amount of different resources is changed, that could lead to a different
outcome, if the most limited resource now favors the other species. The
basic underlying issue is that resources are limited – the same atom of
carbon or nitrogen cannot be used for two different purposes at the same
time.</text><br></p>
<li>
Consider the different effects of intraspecific versus interspecific
competition. Intraspecific competition occurs between members of the
same species and tends to result in increased niche breadth of the
species. In contrast, interspecific competition (between individuals of
different species) is more likely to lead to each competitor species
having narrower niches. Explain why intraspecific competition and
interspecific competition lead to opposite effects on a species’ niche
breadth.
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">Consider competition within one species
(intraspecific). In that case, everyone has extremely similar resource
needs so competition is likely to be strong between individuals for any
of the most important or most limited resources. As a result, any
individual who can use a resource (such as a different food source) that
cannot be used by everyone else in that species will have an advantage.
This means competition with others of your own species favors broadening
your niche, being able to use parts of the environment with less
competition.</text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">Now, when we consider competition between
two species A and B (interspecific), each species has its own resource
needs and efficiency of using those resources. When there are
alternative ways to acquire resources within the niche, and some parts
of the niche overlap with that of species B, whichever species has
higher resource-use efficiency in the niche overlap space will do better
in that area. So, if species A only does better than species B at
temperatures above 75 deg F, then species A is likely to dominate when
the temperature is higher. This will favor species A becoming even
better above that temperature, narrowing its niche. Similarly, species B
is then at a disadvantage above 75 deg F and it will be favorable for
species B to use niche space below that temperature, narrowing its
niche.</text><br></p>
<li>
We think of invasive species as a human-facilitated phenomenon (and in
many cases that’s totally accurate), but is it really true that the
geographic range of a given species has been constant over time? That
is, surely natural species have expanded their ranges in the past, such
that range expansion is not inherently unnatural. After all, the species
that are considered native in this part of Ohio could not have lived
here 13,000 years ago when this place was covered with a mile of
ice—they must have moved here from elsewhere, without human
intervention. <b>Given this, what do you think happens in a community
when a new species is introduced? Discuss what types of species
interactions might occur and how that might influence the ability of the
introduced species to persist in the new area.</b> (You may wish to
focus on a particular example to help you illustrate these points.)
</li>
<p><text style="color:blue">A newly arrived species is likely to face
competition but perhaps less likely to experience predation/herbivory,
parasitism, or mutualism.</text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">When a new species (invasive or not) arrives
in a community, it is likely to experience competition with some of the
existing species. Interestingly, when a new species first arrives any
competition will be interspecies (with other species) and not
intraspecific (with itself) since there will not be many individuals of
the new species around. The existing species will not have a history of
interaction with the new species and so it’s unlikely that the new
species experiences mutualism or parasitism when it first arrives (these
interactions usually exist between species who have coexisted for a long
time). Similarly, the new species may not experience much predation or
herbivory if the consumers in the community do not recognize it as a
food resource. This might mean that the new species, as long as it can
compete for resources, can grow quickly in its new community. However,
if the new species required a specific pollinator or a particular
microbial partner that it did not bring with it, that could mean the new
species would NOT persist well in its new community.</text></p>
<p><text style="color:blue">We can also consider not just what happens
to the new species (which might evolve rapidly in response to the new
conditions), but also what happens to the existing community. Given that
the balance of competition for resources may be disrupted by the arrival
of a new species, some native species may experience decreases in
survival and reproduction if they can no longer acquire the same amount
of important resources. Depending on the other interactions that the
native species engages in, this could have cascading results for other
taxa in the community, for example if a hummingbird-pollinated plant
began to decline, that might mean less food for the hummingbird
population, which might also then decline. Other species might benefit
from the newly introduced species if it does not have much niche overlap
but perhaps the introduced species competes with its predator, thus when
the predator numbers are reduced, the prey species may increase in
numbers – which of course could have cascading effects on the food
resource of the prey species! </text></p>
<text style="color:blue">The underlying point is that the consequences
of species introductions are typically not very predictable and can have
dramatic impacts on the native community.</text><br>
