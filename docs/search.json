Even though CSV comma delimited text files essentially , CSV files preferred format data tables text files .csv extension provides easy way sort filter data files since documentation files (see File Documentation section) often saved text file (.txt extension). Additionally, CSV files readable software easy load computer programs. Data tables always long format unless long format cumbersome (e.g. large community data). long-formatted data table table one row corresponds minimum observable unit data (e.g. single trial individual repeated behavioral assay) multiple rows grouping factors (e.g. individual) single columns data (e.g. choice). However, even long formats seem cumbersome, long formats better wide many reasons. Specifically, long formats allow easy conversion formats. Long formats also allow easy aggregation, subsetting, analysis. example data long format: Every data table REQUIRED column headers. Column headers short easy understand. Avoid using symbols abbreviations whenever possible. example, instead using ‘dc’ denote distance Cuba, use ‘distance_cuba’. Abbreviations helpful, especially analysis coding, can lead difficulties comprehension. Make sure use abbreviations use common, easy understand abbreviations. instance, instead ‘distance_cuba’ use ‘dist_cuba’ since “dist” often-used abbreviation distance. iEco Lab prefer use abbreviations except instances column header long (general guideline headers 15 characters therefore ‘distance_cuba’ long). Additionally, column headers, spaces replaced underscore (.e. “_”). analysis software R functions handle spaces column headers, can cause data erroneously load return errors. Column header conventions made individual projects multiple data tables whole labs. Column header conventions help make data easily combined analysis understood. Column headers also include units. units measurement included meta data file. multiple columns data different units easy convert (e.g. m km) delete one columns convert analysis code needed. exception units header data different units easily converted different scales (e.g. atmospheric pressure, temperature), reason need metric imperial units (e.g. making maps US non-US users). format text (including numbers) data table basic possible. file types used (.e. csv text files) strip formatting text. can cause issues use special characters, symbols, fonts. Therefore, special characters symbols avoided. Additionally, analysis software know read special characters symbols. list acceptable symbols top 10 worst symbols: \\(\\underline{Acceptable \\space Symbols:}\\) \\(\\underline{Symbols \\space \\space Avoid \\space \\space \\space Cost:}\\) text strings (column headers factors 1 character) avoid using capitalized letters possible. use capital letters, make sure consistent use . example, binomial species names capitalize genus species, make sure use framework throughout. example first letter word species name capitalized throughout column. However, good rule thumb follow never use capitalization possible. Entry IDs included tables produce. Entry IDs unique identifiers entry (.e. row) data table. allows easy tracking specific changes make data well allowing easy creation relational keys data tables easy merging. Avoid just using simple row numbers IDs. Good entry IDs alpha-numeric text strings provides information entry, allows easy sorting, number characters entry. IDs typed data simple (numbers characters) complex. often easiest make IDs concatenating multiple columns together separating symbol. example, good entry ID first entry table “20200424_A_02_M” tells us entry site , second species alphabetically, male, made particular survey day. also use ID sort sites species within sites alphabetical earliest survey last. Entry IDs also unique data table meaning ID scheme repeated across tables may later joined. entry ID created point final version data created. timing entry ID made depends specific needs project data editing. entry ID made set entire lifetime data change. However, recommended create entry ID large edits data made. large sections data deleted large gaps entry ID series. worry adding data entry ID created since easy just continue series left . Importantly, entry IDs never recycled even entry deleted. make following change logs difficult. Dates data tables format YYYY-MM-DD, format used. table format used date MM/DD/YYYY. format bad multiple reasons. First, every culture , therefore, computers use format. many regions, day comes month (.e. DD/MM/YYYY). can cause issues dates like 4/5/2020. April 5th May 4th? Computers different cultures also ask question may just assume first number day month depending default setting. year-month-day format dashes year, month, day understood computers software. Additionally, dates YYYY-MM-DD can easily sort data date. including years dates always 4 digits 2020 confused 1920. like character form months (e.g. March Mar) data tables, separate date new column. Missing data handled throughout data table. includes comment columns table. NEVER leave cells blank missing data. Blank cells ambiguous meaning since mean data cell, cell accidentally deleted, erroneously skipped transcription. Instead, use something like ‘NA’ denote missing data. preferred use ‘NA’ denote missing data since read R software way. matter cause missing data (e.g. data recorded, data able recorded, etc.), missing data always represented NA. important project differentiate different causes NAs recorded ‘notes’ ‘comments’ column. specific value wanted denote certain cause missing data (e.g. NR data recorded), decision made PI Project Lead. However, careful reading data statistical software since know value (e.g. NR) means likely read character making whole column character variable. creating data tables, important thing data consistent nature data recorded meta data file (see File Documentation section). example, species names always either common scientific single column, comment columns, comment means thing, kept (e.g. “date recorded” always entered, never “date recorded”, “date missed”, “unrecorded date” ). , comments use commas separate clauses. CSV files, commas used separate field (.e. column). Lastly, make sure leading trailing spaces data. can cause software mess data treat text strings separate levels factor even identical except trailing leading space. Now rework example table ideal formatting look like: Now table uppercase letters, informative alpha-numeric entry ID, data formatted correctly, headers appropriate (.e. ‘Species’ changed ‘common’ uppercase letters).","code":""},{"path":"https://aroles.github.io/biol210/articles/agenda-week0.html","id":"reminders","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Reminders","title":"BIOL 210 Course Agenda","text":"Lab begin next week, Tue Sep 3 Wed Sep 4.

Note somatic chromosomes also called autosomes. ways somatic sex chromosomes differ sexes differing sets sex chromosomes two sex chromosomes contain genetic information (genes shared found one two sex chromosomes). Consider organism ZZ/ZW sex determination, ZZ male ZW female – birds animals . ZW ZZ 2 copies genes autosomes. ZW 1 copy genes Z W. ZZ 2 copies Z genes 0 copies W genes. , genes found Z W, ZW organism one version autosomes (like Chromosome 1), organism two copies every gene. suggests sex chromosomes, organism must way deal difference dosage, mechanism dosage compensation. Remember thinking BarH1 gene number copies gene can impact phenotype, can change gene expression increasing amount transcript produced (thus possibly amount protein). Considering learned transcription translation, suggest 2 different mechanisms gene expression can altered achieve similar levels protein production ZZ ZW individuals, gene found Z chromosome. (Note telling “chromatin state altered” sufficient.) Remember alternative splicing case study discussed things like ! Multiple possiblities exist, . order equalize gene expression, ZZ individual highly methylate histones one Z, greatly reduce prevent gene expression chromosome (like Barr body human females). Alternatively, ZW individual enhance expression genes single Z, perhaps producing extra transcription factors bind enhancers - crease expression individual genes. humans, turns extra missing sex chromosome often effects, compared extra missing autosome. fact, 1 every 1000 live births, newborn either XXX (“female”) XYY (“male”). individuals experience typical physical mental development expected XX XY; may never know extra chromosome unless karyotyped reason. individuals also fertile, producing typical haploid gametes possessing single sex chromosome (children inherit condition). question us : happens gene expression results XXX XYY individuals just like XX XY individuals? Propose explanation lack phenotypic effects karyotype, XXX XYY (reasons likely different…). XXX individual, remember XX individuals already shut one X forming Barr body (X-inactivation). case triple-X, two X’s form Barr bodies. result usual phenotypic expression just one X. XYY individual, genes extra Y expressed aren’t many genes Y-chromosome (55) overexpression may just much effect. fact, National Human Genome Research Institute says age, many men lose Y chromosome cells, without apparent problems. Furthermore, given parents XYY XXX XX XY, happened meiosis yield YY XX gamete (thus giving XXX XYY zygotes)? (can consider: happens meiosis result triploid individual producing typical haploid gametes, X Y?) problem cell division likely happened gamete formation one parents. Alternatively, occur early embryonic development (thus present person’s cells). Assuming event occurred meiosis, individual XYY, gamete father must YY (since females generally Y chromosome). individual XXX, gamete one parent must XX (possibly either parent since carry X). can happen non-disjunction meiosis meiosis II. meiosis , homologous pairs fail separate end daughter cell, yielding 2 daughter cells 2 copies chromosome 2 copies end process. meiosis II, sister chromatids fail separate may 2 regular hap- loid daughter cells 2 aneuploid (one cell 2 copies chromosome one cell copies). Consider Mendel’s Law Segregation. observations led idea segregation? actually happens meiosis explains patterns Mendel observed pea plants? Mendel observed parents different phenotypes offspring, sometimes one parental phenotypes seemed disapear immediate offspring (F1 generation) might reappear F2 generation, like white flower color. led suggest factor causing white flower color factor causing purple flower color remained distinct . didn’t meld together make something new, rather version maintained integrity thus reappear intact later generation. Now know segregation factor, chromosomes, occurs anaphase meiosis, homologous pairs chromosomes separated . also happens point daughter cells become haploid. result segregation, gamete (egg sperm) carries 1 copy flower color gene, either purple allele white allele.
