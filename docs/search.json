Even though CSV comma delimited text files essentially , CSV files preferred format data tables text files .csv extension provides easy way sort filter data files since documentation files (see File Documentation section) often saved text file (.txt extension). Additionally, CSV files readable software easy load computer programs. Data tables always long format unless long format cumbersome (e.g. large community data). long-formatted data table table one row corresponds minimum observable unit data (e.g. single trial individual repeated behavioral assay) multiple rows grouping factors (e.g. individual) single columns data (e.g. choice). However, even long formats seem cumbersome, long formats better wide many reasons. Specifically, long formats allow easy conversion formats. Long formats also allow easy aggregation, subsetting, analysis. example data long format: Every data table REQUIRED column headers. Column headers short easy understand. Avoid using symbols abbreviations whenever possible. example, instead using ‘dc’ denote distance Cuba, use ‘distance_cuba’. Abbreviations helpful, especially analysis coding, can lead difficulties comprehension. Make sure use abbreviations use common, easy understand abbreviations. instance, instead ‘distance_cuba’ use ‘dist_cuba’ since “dist” often-used abbreviation distance. iEco Lab prefer use abbreviations except instances column header long (general guideline headers 15 characters therefore ‘distance_cuba’ long). Additionally, column headers, spaces replaced underscore (.e. “_”). analysis software R functions handle spaces column headers, can cause data erroneously load return errors. Column header conventions made individual projects multiple data tables whole labs. Column header conventions help make data easily combined analysis understood. Column headers also include units. units measurement included meta data file. multiple columns data different units easy convert (e.g. m km) delete one columns convert analysis code needed. exception units header data different units easily converted different scales (e.g. atmospheric pressure, temperature), reason need metric imperial units (e.g. making maps US non-US users). format text (including numbers) data table basic possible. file types used (.e. csv text files) strip formatting text. can cause issues use special characters, symbols, fonts. Therefore, special characters symbols avoided. Additionally, analysis software know read special characters symbols. list acceptable symbols top 10 worst symbols: \\(\\underline{Acceptable \\space Symbols:}\\) \\(\\underline{Symbols \\space \\space Avoid \\space \\space \\space Cost:}\\) text strings (column headers factors 1 character) avoid using capitalized letters possible. use capital letters, make sure consistent use . example, binomial species names capitalize genus species, make sure use framework throughout. example first letter word species name capitalized throughout column. However, good rule thumb follow never use capitalization possible. Entry IDs included tables produce. Entry IDs unique identifiers entry (.e. row) data table. allows easy tracking specific changes make data well allowing easy creation relational keys data tables easy merging. Avoid just using simple row numbers IDs. Good entry IDs alpha-numeric text strings provides information entry, allows easy sorting, number characters entry. IDs typed data simple (numbers characters) complex. often easiest make IDs concatenating multiple columns together separating symbol. example, good entry ID first entry table “20200424_A_02_M” tells us entry site , second species alphabetically, male, made particular survey day. also use ID sort sites species within sites alphabetical earliest survey last. Entry IDs also unique data table meaning ID scheme repeated across tables may later joined. entry ID created point final version data created. timing entry ID made depends specific needs project data editing. entry ID made set entire lifetime data change. However, recommended create entry ID large edits data made. large sections data deleted large gaps entry ID series. worry adding data entry ID created since easy just continue series left . Importantly, entry IDs never recycled even entry deleted. make following change logs difficult. Dates data tables format YYYY-MM-DD, format used. table format used date MM/DD/YYYY. format bad multiple reasons. First, every culture , therefore, computers use format. many regions, day comes month (.e. DD/MM/YYYY). can cause issues dates like 4/5/2020. April 5th May 4th? Computers different cultures also ask question may just assume first number day month depending default setting. year-month-day format dashes year, month, day understood computers software. Additionally, dates YYYY-MM-DD can easily sort data date. including years dates always 4 digits 2020 confused 1920. like character form months (e.g. March Mar) data tables, separate date new column. Missing data handled throughout data table. includes comment columns table. NEVER leave cells blank missing data. Blank cells ambiguous meaning since mean data cell, cell accidentally deleted, erroneously skipped transcription. Instead, use something like ‘NA’ denote missing data. preferred use ‘NA’ denote missing data since read R software way. matter cause missing data (e.g. data recorded, data able recorded, etc.), missing data always represented NA. important project differentiate different causes NAs recorded ‘notes’ ‘comments’ column. specific value wanted denote certain cause missing data (e.g. NR data recorded), decision made PI Project Lead. However, careful reading data statistical software since know value (e.g. NR) means likely read character making whole column character variable. creating data tables, important thing data consistent nature data recorded meta data file (see File Documentation section). example, species names always either common scientific single column, comment columns, comment means thing, kept (e.g. “date recorded” always entered, never “date recorded”, “date missed”, “unrecorded date” ). , comments use commas separate clauses. CSV files, commas used separate field (.e. column). Lastly, make sure leading trailing spaces data. can cause software mess data treat text strings separate levels factor even identical except trailing leading space. Now rework example table ideal formatting look like: Now table uppercase letters, informative alpha-numeric entry ID, data formatted correctly, headers appropriate (.e. ‘Species’ changed ‘common’ uppercase letters).","code":""},{"path":"https://aroles.github.io/biol210/articles/agenda-week0.html","id":"reminders","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Reminders","title":"BIOL 210 Course Agenda","text":"Lab begin next week, Tue Sep 3 Wed Sep 4.

Reproductive isolation underlying idea . build phylogenies think mean defining something species, idea good species evolutionary trajectory, separate species. means reproductively isolated species – exchanging genetic information. built way create phylogenies – define relationships based genetic similarity due shared ancestry. hard define single species concept works cases? might matter species concept choose apply? Multiple reasons hard! One speciation process, ’s binary switch, rarely happens one defined step point time. (exception , course, polylploidy can create new, reproductively isolated species single generation.) Two populations one species can separated may eventually become different species, possibly unable interbreed, also (potentially long) period able interbreed may still gene flow , even look behave differently one another. Another big issue evolution sexual taxa asexual taxa can rather different. Reproduction define species sexual since different individuals bring genetic information together create new individuals. non-sexually reproducing taxa, like bacteria, happen. mean every single bacterium represents separate species since doesn’t exchange genetic information another bacterium? Clearly ! , though don’t use sexual reproduction, bacteria mechanisms exchanging information (horizontal gene transfer). One thing can see common sexual asexual taxa thread genetic similarity – still use criterion case bacteria define species. Along lines, groups taxa, hybridization somewhat distant species unusual (happens bunch plants) might fact act mechanism creating genetic variation. think carefully horizontal gene transfer hybridization mean given example. Note horizontal gene transfer hybridization might “common” evolutionary scale many generations populations still fairly uncommon level likely happen particular individual species. process new species evolve, speciation, commonly divided two general types: allopatric speciation sympatric speciation. ’s difference sympatric allopatric speciation? biologists think matters? Allopatric speciation process two populations diverge different species living separate areas, overlapping geographic range (allo = different, patry = fatherland). Sympatric speciation two populations become difference species live overlapping geographic ranges (sym = , patry = fatherland). Biologists care gene flow (hybridization) two incipient species (beginning become different) can occur much easily two groups found spaces. , speciation seems likely two groups living allopatry compared sympatry. Enough reduction gene flow allow two groups become reproductively isolated seems much difficult achieve sympatry compared allopatry. evolutionary forces important type speciation (sympatric allopatric)? Remembering evolutionary forces ’re thinking : mutation; nonrandom mating; genetic drift; gene flow; selection. won’t consider mutation much ’s slow process different allopatric sympatric. Allopatric: genetic drift gene flow critical. particular, genetic drift likely main driver differences group B living different places. addition, anything reduces rate gene flow B also critical , allowing greater change due drift. Selection may also help differentiate B, live environments different selective pressures (differences salinity, precipitation, altitude). Sympatric: likely gene flow B separate, genetic drift likely won’t contribute much making B different (b/c still connected much gene flow). likely, nonrandom mating (favoring mating individuals group) important creating barriers reproduction. Similarly, selection favors mating individuals group also aid creating barriers interbreeding, thus allowing speciation occur. However, ongoing gene flow can erode differences created nonrandom mating selection, making less likely speciation happens. Selection strong overcome gene flow’s effect. makes sympatric speciation controversial? Many biologists felt ’s nearly impossible nonrandom mating selection stronger effects gene flow. part B evolve different , order continue species future probably need unable mate one another. However, likely require lot time occur… populations “right” mutations arise cause incompatibility. add problem, general sense nonrandom mating selection tend things occur relatively short timescales compared something like gene flow. , environment changes way source natural selection (favored different phenotypes B) disappears, gene flow quickly cause collapse B back single species.  frequency find appear well-defined species (look behave differently) capable fact experience level gene flow. Give hypothesis pairs closely-related species can produce hybrids others . mutliple possible reasonable responses. examples: Closely-related species happen (chance) evolved genetically incompatible able produce fertile hybrids. happen due change structure chromosomes homologous chromosomes can longer pair correctly meiosis. two closely-related species live nearby areas reproduce different times year, benefit evolving avoid breeding since won’t end encountering breeding season. Thus, may inter-fertile. However, breeding possible, favorable avoid breeding species (reduces number offspring survival), thus individuals avoid inter-breeding advantage.  next three questions, ’ll focus couple graphs demonstrating logistic growth. content videos discuss idea logistic growth occurs population can’t keep growing maximum possible rate forever factors like limited resources increasing numbers predators. rate growth slows population size increases, logistic growth form density-dependent growth. describing growth density-dependent, can test limitations growth without observe population size long periods time.

Thus, seeing rate growth tadpoles changes across time response density. see whether density-dependence, need compare lines represent different densities. see lowest density tank (5), tadpoles reach maximum size (perhaps metamorphose frogs) 2-3 weeks. highest density tank (160), tadpoles reach max size longer time, around 9 weeks smaller body mass. change signals us density dependence growth rate.  ’ve probably noticed Figures 1A 1B different axes usually used plot S-shaped logistic growth curve. thing , logistic growth curve (x = time y = population size) doesn’t actually tell us anything underlying change population leads population growth slow density increases. Figures 1A 1B address issue. Gobies tadpoles achieve slower rates population growth different ways. happen case? gobies, fraction population attempting reproduce (build nest) decreases density population increases. relate birth rate larger population lower birth rate (babies born per individual population). happening simply due number nesting sites available breeding area (set number possible places build nest), limit reproduction even plenty food resources. living denser population, tadpoles grow slower. case, ’s likely due food limitation. , tadpoles can’t reproduce metamorphose frogs reach maturity. , slower growth tadpole likely mean lower birth rates population large (also, number offspring often correlated size smaller maturity dense populations, frog likely fewer babies). seems obvious organisms likely experience density-dependent growth (resembling logistic curve), exponential (density-independent) growth? observe populations nature exhibit kind growth — can think examples?

However, sometimes species many populations found different environments. case, ’s possible populations become adapted specific conditions – example salinity soil. populations experience high salinity adapt high frequency alleles helpful high salinity, harmful survival individuals arrive low salinity environments (lack high salinity alleles) breed high salinity individuals. offspring well adapted high salinity.
