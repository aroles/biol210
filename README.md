## Lecture Instructor
Angie Roles (she/her)

Office: Science Center A134

Email: aroles@oberlin.edu

### Drop-In Student Hours
MWF 10-11am, or email for appointment.

Student Hours are times that I have set aside specifically to meet with students. I will be in my office and available – you can just stop by and give the door a knock! You can drop in by yourself or bring friends; you may have specific questions or just want to say hi – any reason is good enough. If you aren't available during these intervals, I'm happy to find another time that works -- just email me with some times you are available. 

## Lecture Class Meetings
MWF 9:00-9:50 am in SCTR A155

Enrollment in both 210 lecture and 211 lab are required of all students. All lab sections meet 1:30-4:20 pm in SCTR K119. See the [BIOL 211 website](https://aroles.github.io/biol211/) for more information.

## Course Description
This course provides biology majors and others with an integrated introduction to key biological principles of genetics, ecology, and evolution, including principles of inheritance, structure and expression of genes, and gene-phenotype relationships, selection, drift, sources of variation, and patterns of diversity, as well as factors and processes governing biotic and abiotic interactions that influence distribution and abundance of organisms. Students must register for both the lecture and laboratory (BIOL 211) concurrently. Prerequisite(s): BIOL 100.

## Course Objectives
Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:

* Understand and apply fundamental evolutionary and ecological consepts.
 Apply all parts of the scientific method to ecological and evolutionary questions.
* Appreciate the nature of variation and the importance of random events in natural systems, across levels of organization from the molecule to the ecosystem.
* Be aware of the broad diversity of life, past and present, and the major patterns of life through time.
* Practice interpreting graphical presentations and statistical analyses of data representing the relationship between two (or more) variables.
* Recognize the relationship of biology to other sciences, disciplines, and society.
* Build 'soft' skills valuable for life-after-college including team work, time management, reflection, revision, self-assessment, and critical thinking.

## Statement on Accessibility and Inclusion

Central to this course is an understanding and appreciation of diversity across the tree of life. In line with that value, we aim to make this course accessible and inclusive of all students. Each individual brings with them a unique set of experiences which inform their perspective when interacting with others and learning new information. All are welcome in this class and expected to put in the work to learn more than you knew coming in. You have the right to ask for assistance, access, or additional resources to meet your learning needs. If you find yourself unable to fully access the course in any way, you are welcome to contact us to discuss your needs. During the first week of classes, we will discuss community norms to guide us in our interactions.

**In case of emergency...** Should circumstances arise that prevent you from fulfilling your responsibilities, such as completing exams on time, you should contact Angie ASAP (email is fine). If you anticipate issues or conflicts arising, please contact Angie in advance so that we may make arrangements.

## Course Structure
This course adopts a flipped classroom style for all lecture meetings and uses contract grading for assessment. Each week, video recordings are provided, to be studied outside of class meeting times (replacing assigned readings; occasionally readings may also be assigned). During the MWF lecture meetings, we will work on case studies or problem sets relating to that week’s material. Some days may be devoted to student-chosen topics. Weekly lab sessions will focus with greater depth on selected lecture topics and associated skills.

## Reference Material and Textbooks

* There are no required textbooks for this course. You are welcome to use your Biology 100 textbook as a reference; the current Biology 100 text is available on reserve in the Science Library. Suggested readings will be available throughout the course via provided PDFs or web links.
* All materials will be shared via the website and using Google Drive. You must be logged into to Google using your Oberlin account to access shared materials on Google Drive. Lab related materials will be shared on the BIOL 211 website.
* The open-source text [Biology 2e](https://openstax.org/details/books/biology-2e) is recommended for many topics when you may wish more information or a different presentation than given in the content videos.

## Honor Code

You are expected to adhere to and sign the Honor Code: 

1. On exams and quizzes, affirming the work is your own, without giving or receiving aid;
2. On problem sets, affirming that the work is your own and, when appropriate, that you have cited references accurately;
3. For group work, all group members contributed to all parts of the assignment in a meaningful way.

Your instructors are required to report any suspected violations of the Honor Code to the Honor Committee. Independent of any deliberations of the Honor Committee, in this course suspected violations of the Honor Code may result in amendment of the grade contract to a D or F if appropriate. More information on the Oberlin Honor Code may be found here: https://www.oberlin.edu/dean-of-students/student-conduct/academic-integrity.
