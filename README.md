## Lecture Instructor
Angie Roles (she/her)
Office: Science Center A134

### Drop-In Student Hours
MWF 10-11am, or email for appointment.

Student Hours are times that I have set aside specifically to meet with students. I will be in my office and available – you can just stop by and give the door a knock! You can drop in by yourself or bring friends; you may have specific questions or just want to say hi – any reason is good enough. If you aren’t available during these intervals, I’m happy to find another time that works -- just email me with some times you are available. 

## Lecture Class Meetings
MWF 9:00-9:50 am in SCTR A155

Enrollment in both 210 lecture and 211 lab are required of all students. All lab sections meet 1:30-4:20 pm in SCTR K119. See the [BIOL 211 website](https://aroles.github.io/biol211/) for more information.

## Course Description
This course provides biology majors and others with an integrated introduction to key biological principles of genetics, ecology, and evolution, including principles of inheritance, structure and expression of genes, and gene-phenotype relationships, selection, drift, sources of variation, and patterns of diversity, as well as factors and processes governing biotic and abiotic interactions that influence distribution and abundance of organisms. Students must register for both the lecture and laboratory (BIOL 211) concurrently. Prerequisite(s): BIOL 100.

## Course Objectives
Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:

* Understand and apply fundamental evolutionary and ecological consepts.
 Apply all parts of the scientific method to ecological and evolutionary questions.
* Appreciate the nature of variation and the importance of random events in natural systems, across levels of organization from the molecule to the ecosystem.
* Be aware of the broad diversity of life, past and present, and the major patterns of life through time.
* Practice interpreting graphical presentations and statistical analyses of data representing the relationship between two (or more) variables.
* Recognize the relationship of biology to other sciences, disciplines, and society.
* Build ‘soft’ skills valuable for life-after-college including team work, time management, reflection, revision, self-assessment, and critical thinking.
